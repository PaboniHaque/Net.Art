  <p> The website I chose to stage my intervention on was Rutgers Canvas, within a discussion post for a class called Public Health Informatics. 
    I decided to choose Canvas because users solely use it to respond to what the instructor has assigned. I do not think I have ever, in the history of
     my Canvas usage, seen someone post something out of the ordinary. This is probably due to the fact that an instructor has the power to penalize your
      grade for such an intervention. In this class, most people post on Sunday night around the same time. I knew this would be the perfect time to post
       to get the most amount of people to view it. My major is Public Health, and most of the people in this course are in Public Health, so we are all 
       constantly writing about social, political, and economic conditions which shape public health. This is why I decided to post something widely 
       different: the best chili recipe. I took inspiration from Joel Holmberg's, "Legendary Accounts." This contrasting response against an extremely 
       technical discussion post question will definitely catch my classmates off guard. Nobody responded to it, and I understand, as people's grades
        depend on their posts. But what is interesting was to analyze my personal thoughts prior to posting it. I was so afraid of consequences or people
         judging me, even on an online discussion with classmates I will never see in person. I am glad I staged this intervention, and I hope people got
          a kick out of it. Or better yet try the recipe out. If I had more time to expand on my intervention, I would continue to post more content that 
          has nothing to do with the question and respond under more of my classmates respones.
